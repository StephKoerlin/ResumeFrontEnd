        <p>
            I am a new IT professional. I have years of experience in sales both in retail and banking but have made big changes.
            I was always the resident tech solver at my previous jobs. Trouble shooting my office's issues and often working through many
            steps before finally breaking down and calling tech support. This often surprised the person on the other line and made me
            realize how much I love being a part of new technology and learning about everything it can offer. I love coding in college
            and problem solving has always been in my blood. The tech field has allowed me to be surprised and delighted daily. I have
            been studying AWS after work when I could but finally just decided to go all in. I recently completed a project called the
            Cloud Resume Challenge and it gave me a huge boost in confidence. I have learned many things along the way from google as
            well as the amazing tech community.
