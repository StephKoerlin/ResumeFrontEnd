#Front End Resources

These are the resources used for the front end of my resume website. They are hosted in an S3 bucket on AWS and through GitHub they are updated if I make any changes. 

Includes:

- index.html - the main writing of my resume
- style.css - the styling for my resume
- 404.html - a 404 error page if something fails
- 404.css - the styling for my 404 page so that it matches my resume
- visitor_count.js - the javascript used to retrieve updated visitor numbers from my API
